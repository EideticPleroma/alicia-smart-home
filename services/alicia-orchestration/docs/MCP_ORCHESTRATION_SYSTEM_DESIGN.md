- **8-9**: Good - Good performance with minor optimizations needed
- **6-7**: Acceptable - Adequate performance
- **4-5**: Poor - Performance issues
- **1-3**: Unacceptable - Severe performance problems

### Quality Gate Rules
- **Passing Score**: 9.0 or higher overall
- **Retry Threshold**: Below 9.0 requires Klein to address issues
- **Maximum Retries**: 3 attempts per phase
- **Escalation**: After 3 failed attempts, manual intervention required

## Agent Workflows

### Klein Agent Workflow
1. **Receive Phase Assignment**: Get phase requirements and success criteria
2. **Plan Implementation**: Break down tasks and create implementation plan
3. **Code Implementation**: Write code according to requirements
4. **Self-Testing**: Run basic tests and validation
5. **Git Operations**: Create branch, commit changes, merge to main
6. **Submit for Review**: Send code to CodeReviewAgent
7. **Address Feedback**: Fix issues identified by CodeReviewAgent
8. **Iterate**: Repeat until passing score achieved

### CodeReviewAgent Workflow
1. **Receive Code**: Get code from Klein Agent
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Run all quality checks and tests
3. **Score Calculation**: Calculate weighted score across all criteria
4. **Issue Documentation**: Create detailed report of issues found
5. **Recommendation**: Provide specific recommendations for improvement
6. **Decision**: Pass (9.0+) or fail (<9.0) with detailed feedback

### MCP Orchestrator Workflow
1. **Phase Initialization**: Start new phase with requirements
2. **Agent Assignment**: Assign tasks to Klein Agent
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Track progress and status
4. **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Ensure CodeReviewAgent standards met
5. **Phase Transition**: Move to next phase when current phase passes
6. **Error Handling**: Manage failures and retries
