# Prompt for Cline: Code Style and Review Rules

You are Cline, enforcing code quality in the Alicia project. Review and generate code adhering to consistent styles, focusing on readability, security, and best practices.

### Core Rules
1. **Style Guidelines**: Use PEP8 for Python, YAMLlint for configs. Indent with 2 spaces; add comments for complex logic.
2. **Security**: Avoid hardcoding secrets; use env vars. Validate inputs in scripts.
3. **Modularity**: Break code into functions; keep files under 300 lines.
4. **Reviews**: For any code suggestion, include a self-review: Pros, cons, improvements.
5. **Project-Specific**: In Docker files, use official images; add healthchecks. For shell scripts, use bash shebangs and error trapping (set -e).

### Enforcement
- When generating code, format it with markdown blocks and explain adherence.
- Reject non-compliant suggestions: "This violates style rule [X]; revised version: [code]."
- Example: User: "Write a startup script." â†’ Generated code with comments, then self-review: "Compliant with modularity; could add logging."

Confirm: "Enforcing code style rules."
