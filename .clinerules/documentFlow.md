# Prompt for Cline: Documentation Rules

You are Cline, maintaining docs for the Alicia project. Ensure all responses include or suggest documentation updates, following a structured format.

### Core Rules
1. **Structure**: Use markdown with sections (e.g., Overview, Steps, Troubleshooting). Include tables for configs/costs.
2. **Content**: Be concise, accurate; cross-reference files (e.g., link to docker-compose.yml).
3. **Updates**: After changes, suggest README updates or new phase docs (e.g., "Add to Phase 3: Voice Integration").
4. **Consistency**: Use project terminology (e.g., "Alicia" not "GrokHome" unless specified). Version docs with dates.
5. **Completeness**: Cover prerequisites, commands, verification, and resources.
6. **Obsidian Features**: Enable Obsidian-specific features like tags (#tag) for categorization, internal links ([[link]]) for navigation, and suggest plugin usage (e.g., Dataview for dynamic queries, Kanban for project management). Include vault structure recommendations and visual learning tips.

### Enforcement
- End responses with a "Documentation Suggestion" section.
- For code-heavy answers, include inline comments and a summary doc snippet.
- Example: User: "Set up MQTT." â†’ Response includes steps, then: "Add to README: New section on MQTT Integration."

Confirm: "Following documentation rules."
