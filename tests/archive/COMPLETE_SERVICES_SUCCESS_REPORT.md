  "timestamp": 1757727487.07
}
```

## 🏗️ **Complete Architecture Overview**

### **Voice Pipeline Architecture**
```
User Voice Input → STT Service (8004) → AI Service (8005) → TTS Service (8006) → Audio Output
                                    ↓
                              Voice Router (8007) → Device Manager (8008)
```

### **Service Communication Flow**
1. **Voice Router** receives voice commands via MQTT
2. **STT Service** processes audio to text using Whisper
3. **AI Service** processes text and generates response using Grok
4. **TTS Service** converts response to speech using Piper
5. **Device Manager** executes device control commands
6. **MQTT Broker** orchestrates all communication

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Docker Network Configuration**
- **Network**: `alicia_network` (bridge network)
- **MQTT Broker**: `alicia_bus_core` (container name)
- **Internal Communication**: All services communicate via container names
- **External Access**: Port mapping for API endpoints

### **Service Port Assignments**
- **MQTT Broker**: 1883 (MQTT), 8883 (MQTTS), 9001 (WebSocket)
- **STT Service**: 8004 (HTTP API)
- **AI Service**: 8005 (HTTP API)
- **TTS Service**: 8006 (HTTP API)
- **Voice Router**: 8007 (HTTP API)
- **Device Manager**: 8008 (HTTP API)

### **Key Fixes Applied**
1. **AsyncIO Event Loop**: Used `asyncio.run(main())` for proper async handling
2. **Task Initialization**: Moved async task creation to main() function
3. **Uvicorn Integration**: Used async uvicorn server for all services
4. **MQTT Integration**: Proper MQTT client setup with async support
5. **Docker Configuration**: Added service_wrapper.py to all Dockerfiles

### **Health Check Results**
- ✅ **MQTT Broker**: Running and accessible
- ✅ **AI Service**: Healthy, MQTT connected
- ✅ **STT Service**: Healthy, Whisper model loaded
- ✅ **TTS Service**: Healthy, Piper TTS ready
- ✅ **Voice Router**: Healthy, MQTT connected
- ✅ **Device Manager**: Healthy, MQTT connected

## 🚀 **Next Steps - Complete Voice Pipeline Testing**

### **Phase 6: End-to-End Integration Testing**
Now that all services are running, we can test the complete voice pipeline:

1. **Voice Command Processing** - Test STT → AI → TTS flow
2. **Device Control** - Test voice commands for device control
3. **MQTT Communication** - Verify message flow between services
4. **Error Handling** - Test error scenarios and recovery
5. **Performance Testing** - Test response times and throughput

### **Testing Commands**
```bash
# Test STT Service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/process -F "audio=@test.wav"

# Test AI Service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8005/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Hello Alicia"}'

# Test TTS Service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8006/synthesize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Hello, how can I help you?"}'

# Test Voice Router
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/process -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"audio":"base64_audio_data"}'

# Test Device Manager
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/command -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"device":"light","action":"turn_on"}'
```
