Feature: MQTT Bus Core Infrastructure
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure the MQTT bus infrastructure is robust and reliable
  So that all services can communicate effectively

  Background:
    Given the MQTT broker is running
    And all core services are initialized
    And the security gateway is active

  @critical @infrastructure
  Scenario: MQTT Broker Health Check
    Given the MQTT broker is running on port 1883
    When I check the broker health status
    Then the broker should be healthy
    And the broker should accept connections
    And the broker should have proper authentication configured

  @critical @infrastructure
  Scenario: MQTT Broker TLS Security
    Given the MQTT broker is configured with TLS
    When I attempt to connect via MQTTS on port 8883
    Then the connection should be encrypted
    And client certificates should be validated
    And the connection should be secure

  @critical @infrastructure
  Scenario: MQTT Broker WebSocket Support
    Given the MQTT broker is running
    When I attempt to connect via WebSocket on port 9001
    Then the WebSocket connection should be established
    And MQTT messages should be transmitted over WebSocket
    And the connection should be stable

Feature: Service Discovery and Registration
  As a service developer
  I want services to automatically register and discover each other
  So that the system can scale dynamically

  Background:
    Given the device registry service is running
    And the discovery service is active
    And the MQTT broker is healthy

  @critical @discovery
  Scenario: Service Registration
    Given a new service wants to join the bus
    When the service publishes a registration message
    Then the device registry should record the service
    And the service should be marked as online
    And other services should be notified of the new service

  @critical @discovery
  Scenario: Service Health Monitoring
    Given a service is registered on the bus
    When the service publishes a health status message
    Then the health monitor should record the status
    And the service status should be updated
    And alerts should be triggered if the service is unhealthy

  @critical @discovery
  Scenario: Service Discovery Query
    Given multiple services are registered on the bus
    When a service queries for available services
    Then the registry should return the list of services
    And the list should include service capabilities
    And the list should include service health status

Feature: Message Routing and Communication
  As a service developer
  I want messages to be routed correctly between services
  So that services can communicate reliably

  Background:
    Given the MQTT broker is running
    And the security gateway is active
    And services are registered on the bus

  @critical @messaging
  Scenario: Point-to-Point Message Delivery
    Given service A wants to send a message to service B
    When service A publishes a message to service B's topic
    Then service B should receive the message
    And the message should be delivered exactly once
    And the message should contain the correct payload

  @critical @messaging
  Scenario: Broadcast Message Delivery
    Given a service wants to broadcast a message
    When the service publishes to a broadcast topic
    Then all subscribed services should receive the message
    And the message should be delivered to all subscribers
    And the message should be processed by each service

  @critical @messaging
  Scenario: Message Acknowledgment
    Given a service sends a message with QoS 1
    When the message is published
    Then the sender should receive an acknowledgment
    And the message should be persisted until acknowledged
    And duplicate messages should be prevented

Feature: Security and Authentication
  As a security administrator
  I want to ensure all MQTT communications are secure
  So that the system is protected from unauthorized access

  Background:
    Given the security gateway is running
    And TLS certificates are configured
    And ACL rules are in place

  @critical @security
  Scenario: Service Authentication
    Given a service wants to connect to the MQTT broker
    When the service provides credentials
    Then the security gateway should validate the credentials
    And the service should be granted appropriate permissions
    And unauthorized access should be denied

  @critical @security
  Scenario: Topic Access Control
    Given a service is authenticated
    When the service attempts to publish to a topic
    Then the ACL should check the service's permissions
    And access should be granted only to authorized topics
    And unauthorized access attempts should be logged

  @critical @security
  Scenario: Message Encryption
    Given a service sends a sensitive message
    When the message is published
    Then the message should be encrypted
    And only authorized services should be able to decrypt it
    And the encryption should use strong algorithms

Feature: Voice Processing Pipeline
  As a user
  I want voice commands to be processed through the MQTT bus
  So that I can control my smart home with voice

  Background:
    Given the voice processing services are running
    And the MQTT broker is healthy
    And the AI service is configured

  @critical @voice
  Scenario: Voice Command Processing
    Given a user speaks a voice command
    When the audio is captured and sent to STT service
    Then the STT service should transcribe the audio
    And the transcription should be sent to AI service
    And the AI service should process the command
    And the response should be sent to TTS service
    And the audio response should be generated

  @critical @voice
  Scenario: Voice Pipeline Error Handling
    Given the voice processing pipeline is running
    When an error occurs in any stage of the pipeline
    Then the error should be logged
    And the pipeline should attempt recovery
    And the user should be notified of the error
    And the system should continue functioning

Feature: Device Integration
  As a smart home user
  I want devices to be controlled through the MQTT bus
  So that I can manage my smart home devices

    And devices are registered

  @critical @devices
  Scenario: Device Control Command
    Given a user wants to control a device
    When a control command is sent via MQTT
    Then the device manager should receive the command

    And the device status should be updated
    And the result should be reported back

  @critical @devices
  Scenario: Device Status Monitoring
    Given devices are connected to the system
    When device status changes
    Then the device manager should detect the change
    And the status should be published to MQTT
    And other services should be notified of the change

Feature: Load Balancing and Scaling
  As a system administrator
  I want the MQTT bus to handle high loads
  So that the system can scale with demand

  Background:
    Given the load balancer service is running
    And multiple service instances are available
    And the MQTT broker is configured for high load

  @performance @scaling
  Scenario: Load Distribution
    Given multiple instances of a service are running
    When requests are sent to the service
    Then the load balancer should distribute requests evenly
    And no single instance should be overloaded
    And response times should remain acceptable

  @performance @scaling
  Scenario: Service Instance Health Monitoring
    Given multiple service instances are running
    When an instance becomes unhealthy
    Then the load balancer should detect the issue
    And the unhealthy instance should be removed from rotation
    And traffic should be redirected to healthy instances

Feature: Error Recovery and Resilience
  As a system administrator
  I want the MQTT bus to recover from failures
  So that the system remains operational

  Background:
    Given the MQTT broker is running
    And services are connected
    And error recovery mechanisms are active

  @resilience @recovery
  Scenario: MQTT Broker Failure Recovery
    Given the MQTT broker fails
    When the broker is restarted

    And the system should resume normal operation

  @resilience @recovery
  Scenario: Service Failure Recovery
    Given a service fails
    When the service is restarted
    Then the service should automatically reconnect to MQTT

    And alerts should be triggered if thresholds are exceeded

  @performance @monitoring
  Scenario: Resource Usage Monitoring
    Given services are running on the MQTT bus
    When system resources are monitored
    Then CPU usage should be tracked
    And memory usage should be tracked
