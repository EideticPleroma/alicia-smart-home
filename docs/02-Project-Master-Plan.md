# Alicia Smart Home AI Assistant: Master Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing Alicia, an open-source AI-powered smart home assistant. The project focuses on creating a scalable, privacy-first solution that integrates seamlessly with existing smart home ecosystems.

The plan covers hardware requirements, software architecture, technical stack, integrations, futureproofing strategies, mobile application, consumer-focused design, and prototyping rollout. The approach emphasizes modularity, affordability, and extensibility to support both individual users and enterprise deployments.

## 1. Hardware #Hardware #Components
- **Core Device (The Brain)**: Raspberry Pi 5 (or Pi 4 for cost-cutting starters)—cheap, powerful, runs Linux. Handles voice processing, AI inference, and hub duties. Why? Scalable: Start with one Pi for a home, cluster 'em for offices/stadiums later. #RaspberryPi #ScalableHardware
- **Audio I/O**: Leverage your existing Sonos speakers over WiFi for output—no need for extras. Pair with a USB mic (e.g., Blue Yeti Nano for clarity). Upgrade path: Group multiple Sonos units via HA for room-to-room audio; keep it modular—no soldering required. #SonosIntegration #AudioSetup
- **Sensors/Actuators**: ESP32 boards for wireless extensions (temp, motion, CO2 sensors like MH-Z19). Lights/blinds: Use your existing single wireless lightbulb (WiFi-compatible like TP-Link Kasa or Philips Hue) for starters. Thermostat: Nest/Ecobee compatibles. Keep it plug-and-play for consumers. #Sensors #SmartDevices
- **Power/Connectivity**: USB-C power, Wi-Fi/Ethernet built-in. Battery backup option for portability (e.g., UPS module). #PowerManagement
- **Dev Kit Extras**: Include breadboards, jumper wires, extra ESP32s for tinkering. For enterprise scale: Rack-mount servers (e.g., Dell PowerEdge) with GPU for heavy AI loads. #DevKit #EnterpriseScale
- **Consumer Focus**: All off-the-shelf—buy from Amazon/Adafruit. Total basic kit under $99: Pi (~$60), mic (~$30), sensors optional add-ons. Repurpose existing gear like Sonos and bulbs to slash costs. #ConsumerFriendly #AffordableTech

## 2. Software #Software #CoreFeatures
- **Base OS**: Home Assistant (HA) core on a custom image—open-source, battle-tested for smart homes. Flash via USB/SD card. Why HA? Handles automations, integrations out-of-the-box. #HomeAssistant #OpenSourceOS
- **AI Layer**: Grok-like LLM (start with open models like Llama 3 or Mistral via Ollama for local inference). Train on user data: Voices (via Mozilla Common Voice datasets or custom recordings), chats/logs, inside jokes (fine-tune with LoRA adapters). Voice choice: Pre-load options (e.g., celebrity mimics, custom synth via Piper TTS), no questions asked. #LLM #Personalization #VoiceTraining
- **Voice Engine**: Wake word ("Hey GrokHome") via Porcupine/Picovoice (offline). STT: Whisper (local). TTS: Coqui or Piper for natural voices. For Sonos output: Use HA's TTS with 'announce' mode to play responses—lowers music volume temporarily, restores after. #VoiceAI #OfflineProcessing
- **Core Features**:
  - Controls: Lights/blinds (dim, color), temps (HVAC integration), Spotify (playlists, queues). #EnvironmentalControl #SpotifyIntegration
  - Utils: Timers, reminders, general Q&A (pull from web via APIs if needed, but local-first for privacy). #Utilities #QA
  - Chat/Games: Conversational AI for banter, inside jokes; simple games like trivia or Tic-Tac-Toe via voice. #ChatAI #Games
- **Privacy Pledge**: No cloud spying—everything local by default. Prove it with open audits. For enterprise: Optional hosted mode with encryption. #PrivacyFirst #NoSpying

## 3. Tech Stack #TechStack #Backend
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI for APIs), Node.js for real-time (e.g., WebSockets for app sync). #Python #NodeJS
- **Database**: SQLite for local (user prefs, logs), scale to PostgreSQL for enterprise. #Database #SQLite
- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face Transformers for LLM fine-tuning. Run on CPU/GPU; optimize for Pi with quantization. #MachineLearning #HuggingFace
- **Networking**: MQTT for device comms (lightweight, scalable). Docker for containerization—easy updates, futureproof. #Networking #Docker
- **Security**: HTTPS everywhere, JWT auth for app/API. No default cloud uplinks—user opts in. Ensure ports 1400 (for updates) and 1443 (for TTS/announce) are open for Sonos WiFi control. #Security #Ports
- **Scalability**: Microservices architecture. Home: Single Pi. Office: Kubernetes on racks. Stadium: Cloud hybrid (e.g., AWS but self-hosted options). #Microservices #Kubernetes

## 4. Integrations and APIs #Integrations #APIs
- **Smart Devices**: IFTTT/Zapier bridges, but native HA add-ons for Hue, Nest, Sonos/Spotify. #SmartIntegrations #IFTTT
- **Music**: Spotify API (OAuth for playlists, voice commands like "Play my chill list"). Sonos-specific: Play Spotify URIs directly; group speakers for multi-room playback. #MusicAPI #MultiRoom
- **General Queries**: Optional Wolfram Alpha or Wikipedia API for facts (local cache to minimize web calls). #KnowledgeAPI
- **Custom APIs**: Expose REST/GraphQL endpoints for dev kit users (e.g., /control/lights, /train/voice). Webhooks for events (e.g., motion triggers lights). #CustomAPI #Webhooks
- **Health/Efficiency**: Integrate CO2 sensors via API; alerts like "Open window" or auto-vent. For enterprise: Occupancy APIs to optimize energy (e.g., API calls to utility providers). #HealthMonitoring #Efficiency
- **Future Integrations**: AR/VR (e.g., Meta Quest API), EVs (Tesla API for charging reminders). #FutureTech #ARVR

## 5. Futureproofing #Futureproofing #Modularity
- **Modular Design**: Plug-in architecture—add new devices via YAML configs in HA. AI models hot-swappable (e.g., upgrade from Llama to newer open models). #ModularArchitecture
- **Updates**: OTA via GitHub (open-source repo). Auto-backups for user data. #OTAUpdates #GitHub
- **Scalability Path**: From Pi to servers—same software stack. API versioning to avoid breaking changes. #ScalabilityPath
- **Tech Trends**: Prep for edge AI (e.g., TensorFlow Lite), 5G for low-latency, quantum-resistant crypto. #EdgeAI #5G
- **Privacy/Ethics**: Built-in toggles for data sharing. Open-source audits to build trust—no spying scandals. #Ethics #Audits

## 6. Phone App Control #PhoneApp #MobileControl
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Flutter/React Native) for iOS/Android. Free download. #Flutter #ReactNative
- **Features**: Remote control (lights, temps), voice chat fallback, live sensor feeds, custom training UI (upload voice samples, add jokes). Sonos controls: Group/ungroup, volume per room. #RemoteFeatures #SonosApp
- **UX**: Simple dashboard—tiles for rooms/devices. Notifications for alerts (e.g., "CO2 high"). Sync via local Wi-Fi or secure tunnel. #UserExperience
- **Integration**: Pairs with core device via QR scan. Offline mode for basics. #QRSetup #OfflineMode
- **Consumer Angle**: No ads, intuitive like a game app. Beta test on your phone first. #ConsumerUX

## 7. Consumer Products Focus #ConsumerFocus #EaseOfUse
- **Ease of Use**: Out-of-box: Plug in, scan QR, connect Wi-Fi—10 mins max. Pre-flashed images for non-techies. Sonos auto-discovers in HA for instant setup. #PlugAndPlay
- **Affordability**: Use commodity hardware (Pi, cheap sensors). Avoid custom PCBs initially. Leverage existing devices like Sonos and bulbs to keep entry low. #Affordability
- **Safety/Compliance**: UL-certified components, voice-only for kids' modes (no creepy listening). #Safety #Compliance
- **Customization**: User picks voice/training—no judgments. Start local, add cloud opt-in for backups. #Customization

## 8. Development Roadmap

The project follows a phased approach to development and deployment:

- **Phase 1: Prototype Development** - Build core functionality with basic voice control, device integration, and AI capabilities using Raspberry Pi and open-source components.
- **Phase 2: System Integration** - Expand device support, implement comprehensive testing, and optimize performance.
- **Phase 3: Voice Pipeline** - Complete STT/TTS integration and enhance AI conversation capabilities.
- **Phase 4: Multi-Language Support** - Add support for multiple languages and advanced features.

Each phase includes thorough testing, documentation updates, and validation of scalability and security measures.

## Summary

This master plan provides a comprehensive technical roadmap for Alicia, emphasizing open-source development, privacy-first design, and scalable architecture.
