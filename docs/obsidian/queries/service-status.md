## ðŸŽ¯ **Service Health Overview**

### **All Services Status**
```dataview
TABLE 
  status as "Status",
  uptime as "Uptime",
  response_time as "Response Time",
  cpu_usage as "CPU %",
  memory_usage as "Memory %"
FROM "services"
WHERE status != null
SORT uptime DESC
```

### **Service Categories**
```dataview
TABLE 
  category as "Category",
  count(rows) as "Total Services",
  count(rows) FILTER WHERE status = "healthy" as "Healthy",
  count(rows) FILTER WHERE status = "warning" as "Warning",
  count(rows) FILTER WHERE status = "error" as "Error"
FROM "services"
GROUP BY category
SORT category ASC
```

### **Performance Metrics**
```dataview
TABLE 
  service_name as "Service",
  avg(response_time) as "Avg Response Time",
  max(response_time) as "Max Response Time",
  avg(cpu_usage) as "Avg CPU %",
  avg(memory_usage) as "Avg Memory %"
FROM "services"
WHERE timestamp > date(today) - dur(1 day)
GROUP BY service_name
SORT avg(response_time) ASC
```

## ðŸš¨ **Alert Summary**
