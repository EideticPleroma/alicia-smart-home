# Wyoming TTS Integration Complete

## Overview

This document describes the completed integration of Wyoming Protocol TTS with Sonos audio output, creating a unified voice assistant system that eliminates dual Piper implementations and provides seamless audio playback through Sonos speakers.

## Architecture Overview

### Before Integration
```
Alicia Assistant → Wyoming Protocol → wyoming-piper (Docker)
                                      ↓
Sonos MQTT Bridge → Local Piper Binary → Sonos Speakers
```

### After Integration
```
Alicia Assistant → MQTT → Sonos MQTT Bridge → Sonos Speakers
                                      ↓
Unified TTS Service ← Wyoming Protocol ← Home Assistant (future)
```

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Unify Piper TTS Architecture ✅

#### Changes Made:
1. **Updated Alicia Assistant** (`voice-processing/alicia_assistant.py`)
   - Modified `synthesize_with_piper()` to use MQTT instead of Wyoming protocol
   - Added `use_wyoming=True` flag for protocol compatibility
   - Maintained API compatibility while redirecting to MQTT

2. **Created Unified TTS Service** (`voice-processing/unified-tts-service.py`)
   - Wyoming protocol server on port 10200
   - MQTT client for Sonos communication
   - Audio file generation and HTTP URL serving
   - Automatic cleanup of temporary audio files

3. **Updated Docker Configuration** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   - Replaced `wyoming-piper` service with `unified-tts-service`
   - Added volume mounts for audio file sharing (`./tmp/audio:/tmp/audio`)
   - Updated service dependencies and environment variables

### Phase 2: Audio Pipeline Integration ✅

#### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Sonos MQTT Bridge** (`mqtt-testing/scripts/sonos-mqtt-bridge.py`)
   - Added `_play_tts_with_wyoming_audio()` method
   - Enhanced `handle_tts_command()` with Wyoming protocol support
   - Implemented hybrid TTS approach (Wyoming + traditional methods)
   - Added proper error handling and logging

2. **MQTT Protocol Extensions**
   - Added `use_wyoming` flag to TTS payloads
   - Added `audio_url` field for pre-generated audio
   - Enhanced status reporting with Wyoming protocol indicators

### Phase 3: End-to-End Testing ✅

#### Test Coverage:
1. **MQTT Connectivity Tests**
   - Broker connection validation
   - Topic subscription verification
   - Message publishing/receiving tests

2. **Wyoming Protocol Tests**
   - Service connectivity validation
   - TTS synthesis testing
   - Audio chunk collection and validation

3. **End-to-End Pipeline Tests**
   - Complete voice command → STT → Processing → TTS → Sonos flow
   - Multi-language support validation
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

4. **Audio Quality Tests**
   - Format validation (WAV/MP3)
   - Performance metrics (latency, processing time)
   - File size and quality verification

## API Usage

### MQTT TTS Command Format
```json
{
  "speaker": "kitchen",
  "message": "Hello from Wyoming TTS",
  "language": "en",
  "volume": 30,
  "use_wyoming": true,
  "audio_url": "http://192.168.1.100:8080/audio.wav"
}
```

### Wyoming Protocol Usage
```python
# Connect to unified TTS service
async with AsyncTcpClient("localhost", 10200) as client:
    # Send synthesis request
    synthesize_event = Synthesize(text="Hello world", voice="en_US-lessac-medium")
    await client.write_event(synthesize_event.event())

    # Receive audio response
    while True:
        event = await client.read_event()
        if event.type == "audio-chunk":
            # Process audio chunk
            pass
        elif event.type == "audio-stop":
            break
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# MQTT Configuration
MQTT_BROKER=alicia_mqtt
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USERNAME=tts_service
MQTT_PASSWORD=alicia_ha_mqtt_2024

# Wyoming Service Configuration
WHISPER_URL=tcp://alicia_wyoming_whisper:10300
PIPER_URL=tcp://alicia_unified_tts:10200
```

### Docker Volumes
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./voice-processing/models/piper:/usr/local/bin/piper/models:ro
  - ./tmp/audio:/tmp/audio
```

# Check audio file generation
ls -la tmp/audio/
```

## Migration Guide

### From Dual Piper Setup
1. **Stop existing services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
