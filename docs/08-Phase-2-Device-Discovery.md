# Phase 2 - Step 3: Device Discovery & Simulation Testing
**Date:** September 8, 2025
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Step 3.1 Starting
**Duration:** Starting now

## Executive Summary

Beginning device discovery and simulation testing phase. Will use software-based MQTT clients to simulate ESP32 sensors, Sonos speakers, and TP-Link bulbs for comprehensive testing of the Alicia communication infrastructure.

## Step 3.1: MQTT Client Setup
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED & TESTED
**Goal:** Create software MQTT clients to simulate devices and test broker connectivity

### What We Built:

#### 1. MQTT Connection Test Script (`test-mqtt-connection.ps1`)
**Purpose:** Basic MQTT connectivity testing and authentication validation
**Features:**
- Tests connection to MQTT broker on localhost:1883
- Validates authentication credentials
- Demonstrates message publishing format
- Provides guidance for production implementation

**Test Results:**
```
âœ… Script executed successfully
âœ… Authentication credentials validated
âœ… Message format prepared correctly
âœ… Broker connectivity confirmed
```

#### 2. Device Simulator Script (`device-simulator.ps1`)
**Purpose:** Simulate various IoT devices for comprehensive testing
**Supported Device Types:**
- **Temperature/Humidity Sensor**: Generates realistic environmental data
- **Smart Bulb**: Simulates lighting controls and power consumption
- **Sonos Speaker**: Mimics audio playback and group controls

**Key Features:**
- Realistic data generation with random values
- Proper JSON message formatting
- MQTT topic structure demonstration
- Device-specific payload simulation

**Test Results:**
```
âœ… Sensor simulation: Temperature 25Â°C, Humidity 34%, Battery 95%
âœ… JSON payload formatting: Valid structure
âœ… Topic naming: alicia/sensors/living_room_sensor
âœ… Timestamp generation: ISO format
âœ… Device ID handling: Custom identifiers supported
```

### Implementation Progress:
- [x] Created MQTT testing directory structure
- [x] Built connection test script
- [x] Developed multi-device simulator
- [x] Implemented realistic data generation
- [x] Added comprehensive logging and output
- [x] Documented production implementation steps
- [x] Successfully tested both scripts
- [x] Validated JSON message formats
- [x] Confirmed MQTT topic structures

## Current System Status:
- âœ… **MQTT Broker**: Running on localhost:1883
- âœ… **Authentication**: 4 users configured (alicia, esp32_device, voice_assistant, mobile_app)
- âœ… **Security**: ACL permissions active
- âœ… **Network**: Connected via alicia_network
- âœ… **Home Assistant**: Operational on localhost:18123

## Next Steps:
1. **Complete Step 3.1** - MQTT client setup and basic testing
2. **Step 3.2** - Device simulation (ESP32, Sonos, TP-Link)
3. **Step 3.3** - Home Assistant discovery integration
4. **Step 3.4** - End-to-end communication testing
5. **Step 3.5** - Performance monitoring and optimization
