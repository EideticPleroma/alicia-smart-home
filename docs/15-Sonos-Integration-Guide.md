- ✅ Network connectivity between all components

### Network Configuration
- **Home Assistant**: `localhost:8123`
- **MQTT Broker**: `localhost:1883`
- **Sonos Speakers**: `192.168.1.100-102` (example IPs)

---

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup

1. **Update Home Assistant Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy and edit the .env file
   cp home-assistant/.env.example home-assistant/.env

   # Update with your actual Sonos speaker IPs
   SONOS_HOST_LIVING_ROOM=192.168.1.100
   SONOS_HOST_KITCHEN=192.168.1.101
   SONOS_HOST_BEDROOM=192.168.1.102
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd mqtt-testing/scripts
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 2: Home Assistant Configuration

The following files have been configured:

#### **Step 1: MQTT Integration Setup (UI Required)**
**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** MQTT connection settings must be configured through the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for and select **MQTT**
4. Configure:
   - **Broker**: `127.0.0.1`
   - **Port**: `1883`
   - **Username**: `homeassistant`
   - **Password**: `your_password_here`

#### `configuration.yaml` - Sonos Integration
```yaml
# Sonos Integration
sonos:
  media_player:
    hosts:
      - 192.168.1.101
      - 192.168.1.102
      - 192.168.1.103

# Text-to-Speech Integration
tts:
  - platform: google_translate
    language: 'en'
    cache: true
    cache_dir: /tmp/tts
    time_memory: 300
```

#### `configuration.yaml` - MQTT Entities (Optional)
You can still define MQTT-based entities in YAML after setting up the MQTT integration via UI:
```yaml
# Example MQTT Sensor
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Living Room Temperature"
    state_topic: "home/livingroom/temperature"
    unit_of_measurement: "°C"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temp }}"

# Example MQTT Switch
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Bedroom Light"
    state_topic: "home/bedroom/light/status"
    command_topic: "home/bedroom/light/set"
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
```

#### `automations.yaml` - Sonos Automations
- **TTS Announcements**: Play voice messages through speakers
- **Volume Control**: Adjust speaker volume via MQTT
- **Playback Control**: Play/pause/stop music playback
- **Group Management**: Create multi-room audio groups
- **Status Monitoring**: Periodic status updates

### Step 3: MQTT Configuration

#### ACL Permissions Added
```acl
# Sonos Speaker User
user sonos_speaker
topic write alicia/devices/sonos/+/status
topic write alicia/audio/+/status
topic write homeassistant/media_player/#
topic read alicia/commands/sonos/+
topic read alicia/tts/+
topic read alicia/audio/+/command
```

#### Password File Updated
- Added `sonos_speaker` user with authentication credentials

### Step 4: Start Services

1. **Start MQTT Broker**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d mqtt
   ```

2. **Start Home Assistant**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d homeassistant
   ```

3. **Start Sonos MQTT Bridge**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Host Networking (Recommended for development)
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.host.yml up --build sonos-bridge

   # Option 2: Macvlan Networking (More secure, but complex)
   # docker-compose -f docker-compose.sonos.yml --profile macvlan up --build sonos-bridge-macvlan
   ```

   > **🔒 Security Note**: The host networking option is used for development simplicity. For production deployment, consider using macvlan networking or bridge networking with proper firewall rules to isolate the container from the host network.
